# Introduction

In Canada the large sections of the social economy, known by its various components as the nonprofit sector, charitable sector, social enterprise primarily operates as though we are in a post-racial society [@dacostaThinkingPostRacialIdeology2016].
In a post racial society, which is a utopian construct rather than a current reality, racial prejudices are not part of institutional structures and historical racial inequalities have been overcome to create equity for all.
In this imagined post racial society the nonprofit sector is not impacted by racial hierarchies.
In other words in a post racial society anyone, regardless of racial or ethnic background can form a nonprofit organization or a charity, or a social enterprise, and can be part of the leadership team in a social economy organization.
The post-racial philosophy is one of the reasons the social economy in Canada has been resistant to collecting sectoral and leadership data on race and ethnicity despite long term calls to deal with the diversity issue in the sector [@mcisaacDiversityInclusionMowat2].
>"Based on recent survey findings, the not-for-profit sector in Ontario does not appear to be diverse in its leadership, or to have a strong commitment to diversity and inclusion at the organizational level." [@mcisaacDiversityInclusionMowat2].

 More recent calls for diversity data in the social ecnomy have been expressed by Senator Ratna Omidvar, to specifically report on the diversity of Canadian charity boards and leadership [@omidvarCanadianNonProfitBoards2020014].

The lack of data on race and ethnicity in the social economy limits the ability of both academic and community research on the topic.
It is not that researchers are not interested in the topic of race and ethnicity in the social economy, but since the data is not available for analysis it therefore requires expensive research budgets to acquire primary data and therefore published studies are few and far between [@meinhardCivicParticipationVisible2011].
This research therefore addresses this gap by utilizing inferences from available literature and available Open Data.   
This research specifically describes a top down approach to understanding charitable organizations in Canada, through the sociological lens of racialized immigrants, and their interaction with environmental issues as a case study.
Open data is utilized form Canadian government departments, such as Immigration and Citizenship Canada and Canada Revenue Agency. For example, charities serving racialized immigrants in Canada are identified from available Canada Revenue Agency data.

## Motivation for research
Research on charities indicates racialized communities being underserved both in terms of number of services and types of services [@trueloveServicesImmigrantWomen2000].
As a troubling phenomenon, research indicates that the number of charities per capita decreases when the proportion of racialized population increases [@garrowRACIALETHNICCOMPOSITION2015].
There are additional concerns that the incumbent charitable sector organizations do not support the development and growth of organizations led by women from racialized communities [@taylorStateDiversityEnvironmental2014].  
Unless the nonprofit sector in Canada and the government acknowledges these issues and starts to address them, Canada will end up repeating the same problematic phenomenon of smaller number of organizations serving racialized communities as the United States [@senguptaFutureSocialEconomy2016].

This particular research study identifies structural issues limiting the growth of charities serving racialized immigrants.
First, this research starts at a point that many researchers take as a given, that is the taxonomy of charities in Canada, as determined by Revenue Canada.
Taxonomies are powerful ontologies and structures when they restrict and constrain types of organizations.
For example, if charities serving racialized immigrants are limited to a taxonomical classification of employment generation, the activities they can perform are limited.
Second, the way charities are funded is another form of structural limitation.
For example if charities serving racialized immigrants are funded primarily to achieve labour market outcomes, they will not have the capacity to provide other services related to health, environment and other forms of wholistic well being.[@vahabiPerceivedBarriersAccessing2013]
Third the amount of funding matters, if charities serving racialized immigrants are limited by classification and funding accountability objectives, organizational funding will be limited.
Fourth, the leadership and community roots of all organizations matter.
The services provided by a mainstream charity for racialized immigrants will be different in cultural basis from services provided by organizations formed by different immigrant communities and for their own community.

##  The Power of Classification and Formal Taxonomies
Taxonomies are powerful ontologies and structures when they restrict the formation and constrain of operations of different types of organizations.
As an example, a charity in Canada is both required to carry out specific types of activities, and is restricted to being a registered nonprofit organization by law.
There are three types of social economy organizational taxonomies that are considered in this paper:
1. Government driven organizational taxonomies.
The purposes of these taxonomies include recognition of organizations as formal entities, and administration these organizations.
2. Social economy driven organizational taxonomies.  
The purposes of these taxonomies include referrals from one organization to another, and funding for organizations from foundations.
3. Academic research driven organizational taxonomies.
The purposes of these taxonomies include analysis of similarities and differences between organizations, and summary of patterns across organizations.

### Government driven organizational taxonomies
The focus of this paper will be on Government driven organizational taxonomies.
Examples of government driven organizational taxonomies include Category Code, Sub-Category Code, and Charity Type required by Revenue Canada for charities in Canada filing their annual returns.
Another example of Government driven organizational taxonomies is the US National Taxonomy of Exempt Entities [(NTEE)](https://nccs.urban.org/project/national-taxonomy-exempt-entities-ntee-codes), which is a classification system for nonprofit organizations developed by the National Center for Charitable Statistics.
The US Internal Revenue Service (IRS) classifies nonprofit organizations using the NTEE system.

### Social economy driven organizational taxonomies
Social economy organizational taxonomies are valuable since they are created by the sector for the sector.
The most well known social economy taxonomies are Information and Referral Systems for social services.
An example of a Canadian Information and Referral System is [Ontario 211](https://211ontario.ca/).
One of the key differences between government driven organizational taxonomies and social economy driven organizational taxonomies is that social economy driven organizational taxonomies are more centered around the needs of organizations and individuals requiring services rather than the needs of government.
For example the top level alphabetical classification in Ontario 211 intended to help users find required services:
* Abuse / Assault
* Community Programs
* Disabilities
* Emergency / Crisis
* Employment / Training
* Family services
* Food
* Francophones
* Government / Legal
* Health Care
* Homelessness
* Housing
* Income Support
* Indigenous Peoples
* LGBTQ+
* Mental Health / Addictions
* **Newcomers**
* Older Adults
* Youth

The purposes of these taxonomies include referrals from one organization to another, and funding for organizations form non government foundations.

Notably, Newcomers is a top level category on the 211 Ontario homepage connecting to organizations serving immigrants, and this is a significant difference form the CRA taxonomy which classifies immigrant serving organizations at a secondary level.

Another social economy taxonomy [The Open Eligibility Project](https://company.auntbertha.com/the-open-eligibility-project/) uses Human Situations to describe individual characteristics that can be matched orgnizational Human Services.
Of note, immigrant related classifications are a top level category under "Citizenship".

>Citizenship
* Immigrants
* Refugees
* Undocumented


The essential point being made here is that it matters who decides how to classify organizations, having implications on the types of organizations and the ability identify them and access their services.

### Academic research driven organizational taxonomies
The most well know article on organization types was written by [@dimaggioIronCageRevisited1983], who determined that within a sector, organizations tend to become similar over time.

# Charities in Canada
Charities in Canada are incorporated org. Examples of government driven organizaitonal taxonomies include anizations and are approved by Canada Revenue Agency (CRA) based on a set of criteria.
An important distinction in the social economy between Canada and other jurisdictions such as the U.S., is that in Canada all charities are non-profits, but all non-profits are not charities.
In the U.S. nonprofits are charities and can accept charitable donations.
In Canada where not all non-profits are charities, and therefore not all nonprofits in Canada can accept charitable donations or issue tax receipts.
Charities in Canada are a specific legal organizational designation that can accept, for example, financial donations and issue charitable tax receipts.
Non-profits in Canada have a broader legal designation that cannot for example issue charitable tax receipts.
Detailed differences between charities and nonprofit organizations in Canada are described by [Canada Revenue Agency](https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/charities-giving/giving-charity-information-donors/about-registered-charities/what-difference-between-a-registered-charity-a-non-profit-organization.html).
Furthermore, nonprofits in Canada can be registered or incorporated at both federal and provincial levels.
Since nonprofits in Canada can be incorporated at federal or provincial levels a complete list of nonprofit organizations requires publication of a list of nonprofits by both federal and provincial governments.  
No published list of nonprofit organizations across Canada exists, much to the chagrin of the sector.
Even worse, social sector advocates have had to take provincial governments to court to require the government publish a list of provincially registered nonprofit organizations (Blumberg).
This research focuses on charities in Canada, and specifically on data published by the CRA on Charities in Canada.

## Canada Revenue Agency
[Canada Revenue Agency](https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency.html) is the regulator for the charitable sector in Canada.
The analysis also uses a sociological lenses, immigration and disability to analyze the data.
To this authors knowledge, no analysis of CRA T3010 data has been completed with a primary focus on racialized immigrants. @brouardT3010ChallengesResearch2014

### Canada Revenue Agency T3010 data
T3010 is the name of the CRA form through which charities in Canada file their primary financial reports with the government of Canada.
T3010 data is therefore the data filled out by Canadian charities in the CRA form.
T3010 data is vital not only to the government but also to researchers researching the social economy in Canada.
T3010 information is filed on an annual basis by charities, and therefore T3010 data provides the most current "snapshot" of charities in Canada.
It is useful to note that T3010 information is different from an "Annual Report" published by many Canadian charities.
Since T3010 data is information reported to the government in a standardized format, it is more amenable to analysis across hundreds or thousands of organizations.
Annual reports on the other hand, provide valuable information about the charity to constituents and stakeholders, but the non-standard formats make analysis beyond a limited number of reports impossible without substantial human resources.
Most usefully, T3010 data is provided by CRA to Canadian citizens free of charge.
* A public and searchable version of T3010 data per individual charity is provided on the [CRA website](https://apps.cra-arc.gc.ca/ebci/hacc/srch/pub/dsplyBscSrch?request_locale=en).  
* A less well known but still public file listing Canadian charities is provided through the Canadian Governments [Open Data Portal](https://open.canada.ca/en/open-data)
* A set of files providing the T3010 information completed by Canadian Charities is also provided to Canadians through [informal information requests](https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/charities-giving/charities/information-about-a-charity.html)
The set of T3010 data files used for this analysis was obtained through an  informal information request, and was received in a CD by postal mail in July 2020.
An downloadable version was requested, but the CD by postal mail is the current process for distribution of these files.
The files requested and received cover 20 years of CRA T3010 data, and the files for the year 2018 are used here for initial analysis since it is the most recent and most complete set of CRA T3010 data.
* The set of CRA T3010 data is published on a more easily searchable website [charitydata](https://www.charitydata.ca/) by Blumbergs, which is a firm specializing in Canadian Charity Law.
* There have been other projects providing dynamic search databases of CRA T3010 data, therefore CRA T3010 is a valuable resource utilized by multiple stakeholders.



### CRA T3010 data for 2018
The files for the year 2018 were used as they are the "most" complete.
Even though files for years 2019 and 2020 were available, they are not as complete as the 2018 file since there is a lag in reporting time.  
Generally, Canadian charities have six months from the end of the fiscal year to report  their returns
i.e. data for 2019 is reported in 2020, and in July 2020 when the files were created, not all charities will have completed their reporting for 2019, including only ~ 200 organizations.
Similarly the file for 2019 only contains the reports for 2018 which have been submitted as of July 2020, a total of ~ 40,000 charities
2018 files containing information for ~ 85,000 charities therefore contain both recent and most complete set of CRA T3010 data.

The following files were provided for the year 2018:
1. Category_Sub-Category.csv
2. Country.csv
3. Designation.csv
4. Form Versioning Details.csv
5. Programs.csv
6. Province.csv

#### Category_Sub-Category.csv File
This file contains the following fields:
* Category Code
* Category English Desc
* Category French Desc
* Sub-Category Code
* Sub-Category English Desc
* Sub-Category French Desc
* Charity Type
* English Desc
* Charity Type
* French Desc

The fields in the Category_Sub-Category.csv are designed to support two purposes, first to match the categories of charities laid out in legislaton: [Charities Registration (Security Information) Act](https://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/C-27.55/index.html). Second codes rather than long form descriptions allow more efficient form data entry and verification.

The Charity Type field in the Category_Sub-Category.csv file for example has four categories in accordance with the Charities Registration (Security Information) Act:

1. relief of poverty (food banks, soup kitchens, and low-cost housing units)
2. advancement of education (colleges, universities, and research institutes)
3. advancement of religion (places of worship and missionary organizations)
4. purposes beneficial to the community (animal shelters, libraries, and volunteer fire departments)

The short list of formal charity types is fairly restrictive, and the Category and Sub Category fields provide a more detailed set of classification possibilities.

Significantly, the first level of categories provided in the CRA T3010 data does not include racialized immigrants, or immigrants as a separate category.
Although it can be argued that some categories such as religion, will include a high proportion of immigrants, it  is not the same as having a category or categories for immigrants.
The categories generally follow the four broader classifications of charities in Canada:
1. relief of poverty
2. advancement of education
3. advancement of religion
4. purposes beneficial to the community

A minor note, the overall categories have gaps in numbering for categories that were previously created by no longer used.

##### Sub Category Code field

Again we will find a lack of fields for categorizing charities whose primary purpose is serving racialized immigrants.
Two specific classifications related to immigrants were found.
The first is the Subcategory: Refugee (support and settlement assistance),found under the broader Category Organizations Relieving Poverty.
The second is the Subcategory: Immigrant Services (jobs / language / etc.),found under the broader Category: Community Resource.

Another important factor is if a charity categorizes itself as an organization providing Immigrant Services, it is not classifying itself  as an organization that provides environmental services.
Therefore organizations that have multiple purposes are not able to classify themselves into these multiple categories.  

The following list of tables is long and exhaustive, there were a total of 31 Categories of Charities and 252 subcategories in 2018 allowed by the CRA.
The purpose of providing the complete list here is to demonstrate what categories are available, and what categories have been developed to a greater level of detail, while simultaneously what categories and subcategories have remain undeveloped.

##### Observations from table Number of Charities reporting in 2018 by Category and SubCategory
A number of observations can be made from this table:
1. No Canadian charities were classified as "Immigrant Services" in 2018 (categories with no charities were not included in the table to reduce table size)
2. Only 133 charities out of a total of 84,355 charities (0.16%) were classified as serving Refugees (support and settlement assistance).
3.  There are a significant number of charities classified in the "Other" subcategory for each given charity, indicating a need for updating the categories and subcategories.  
In fact only 133 out of a total of 252 Category/Sub Category combinations were used, and given almost half of the categories are not used, a revised classification scheme would be useful.

#### Charity Program Classifications
This section examines classifications of programs, both in terms of the allowed classifications, and in terms of how the charities classify themselves. Since Canadian charities can classify themselves in terms of multiple programs, a more nuanced picture of who the charities serve should emerge form the program classifications.

The following program classifications were available from the 2018 files provided by Canadian Revenue Agency:
