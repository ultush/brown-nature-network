# Immigrant Charities in Canada

This file describes a top down approach to understanding charitable organizations in Canada, through the sociological lens of immigrants, and people with disabilities and their interaction with environmental issues. Charities serving Immigrants and people with disabilities in Canada are identified from available  Canada Revenue Agency data.

## Canada Revenue Agency
[Canada Revenue Agency](https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency.html) is the regulator for the charitable sector in Canada. Charities in Canada incorporated organizations and are approved by Canada Revenue Agency (CRA) based on a set of criteria.
An important distinction in the social economy between Canada and other jurisdictions such as the US, is that non-profits in the U.S. are charities and can accept charitable donations unlike in Canada where not all non-profits are charities.
Charities in Canada are a specific legal organizational designation that can accept, for example, financial donations and issue charitable tax receipts.
Non-profits in Canada have a broader legal designation that cannot for example issue charitable tax receipts.
Furthermore, nonprofits in Canada can be registered or incorporated at both federal and provincial levels.
Therefore, in Canada all charities are non-profits, but all non-profits are not charities.
This research focuses on charities in Canada, and specifically on data published by the CRA on Charities in Canada.
The analysis also uses two sociological lenses, immigration and disability to analyze the data.
To this authors knowledge, no analysis of T3010 data has been completed with a primary focus on immigrants or people with disabilities. (reference Brouard and other research on T3010 Data)

### Canada Revenue Agency T3010 data
T3010 is the name of the CRA form through which charities in Canada file their primary financial reports with the government of Canada.
T3010 data is therefore the data filled out by Canadian charities in the CRA form.
T3010 data is vital not only to the government but also to researchers researching the social economy in Canada.
T3010 information is filed on an annual basis by charities, and T3010 data provides the most current "snapshot" of charities in Canada.
Most importantly, T3010 data is provided by CRA to Canadian researchers and academics free of charge on request.
A public an more limited but searchable version of T3010 data is provided on the [CRA website] (https://apps.cra-arc.gc.ca/ebci/hacc/srch/pub/dsplyBscSrch?request_locale=en)
